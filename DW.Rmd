## Welcome to the 'Tidyverse'
- Home of `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `readr` et. al
- It's maifesto: http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf
  Hadley's paper in Journal of Open Source Software
- Packages in the tidyverse aim to help you achieve that ideal tidy form.
- The payoff is packages geared toward that form can accelerate your presentation and analysis. e.g. `ggplot2`, `caret` etc.
- Code also conforms to patterns that make it easy to read: Split, Apply, Combine (more on that soon)

## Drawbacks of Tidyverse
- The Tidyverse is a great place to start.
- BUT it has a specific idealogy: Modify data in place?

- The implications are suboptimal processing speed and memory usage. Most often this is worth it. Sometimes atlernatives will be a better choice...


## Alternative 1:  Data.Table
- Provides `fread()`: Super fast at reading gigabytes of delimeted data (.csv etc)
- Can apply split, apply, combine type operations 'in place' (no big copies).
- Familiar concepts to database programmers.
- Chained operations get ugly fast. (example soon)

## Alternative 2: Base R!
- `read.csv()`, `data.frame`, `*apply()` functions, `[,]` adressing are still super conventient tools to have in your wrangling kit.

## Alternative 3: Domain Specific 
- Sometimes the data frame concept is just wrong. 
- Image analysis is about matrices for example.
